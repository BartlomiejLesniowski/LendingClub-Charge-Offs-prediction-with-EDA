# LendingClub Charge-Offs Prediction with EDA

**Author:** Bart≈Çomiej Le≈õniowski  
**Date:** 04.12.2024

A machine-learning pipeline to predict which LendingClub loans will charge off, accompanied by exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to equip investors with an early-warning tool before a loan is fully funded.

## Project Overview

LendingClub is the world‚Äôs largest P2P lending marketplace. In this project, we:

- Perform EDA on a ~1.55 GB loan dataset with 151 columns.  
- Engineer a target feature indicating ‚Äúcharged-off‚Äù vs. ‚Äúfully paid.‚Äù  
- Train and compare four classifiers:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
- Identify the best model for early risk detection.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/lendingclub-chargeoffs.git
   cd lendingclub-chargeoffs

2. **Create & activate virtual environment**

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. **Install dependencies**

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Dataset**

Source: LendingClub loan data (publicly available).

Size: ~1.55 GB, 151 columns

Selection criteria:

Only features known prior to loan funding

Dropped post-funding columns to prevent data leakage


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Checked distributions of key numeric features (e.g., loan amount, interest rate).

Assessed skew and applied log transforms where needed.

Visualized categorical counts (grade, sub_grade, purpose).

Correlation heatmaps to spot multicollinearity.


**Data Processing**

Missing values:

Dropped columns with > 90% missing.


Imputed median for numeric, mode for categorical.

Feature engineering:

Converted issue dates into year/month.

Binned continuous variables (e.g., annual income).


Target creation:

charge_off = 1 if status is ‚ÄúCharged Off,‚Äù else 0.



**Modeling**

Train/Test Split

Split data into 80% train / 20% test.

Stratified on target to preserve class balance.

Scaling & Encoding

StandardScaler on numeric features.

One-hot encoding for categoricals.


**Algorithms**

Model	- Key Params

Logistic Regression	- solver='lbfgs', max_iter=1000

K-Nearest Neighbors	- n_neighbors=5

Decision Tree	- max_depth=5

Random Forest	- n_estimators=100, max_depth=8


**Results & Evaluation**

Metrics used:

ROC-AUC

Precision, Recall, F1‚Äìscore

Confusion Matrix


**Best performer: Random Forest**

ROC-AUC: 0.93

Precision/Recall/F1: 0.91 / 0.93 / 0.93


Detailed classification reports and ROC curves are in the notebook.


**Conclusions**

Random Forest and Decision Tree outperform simpler models in detecting charge-offs.

While not perfect, these models offer actionable signals to investors pre-funding.



**Usage**

Launch the notebook:

bash

jupyter notebook "LendingClub Charge Offs prediction with EDA.ipynb"

Follow each section sequentially to reproduce the analysis & modeling.


To retrain on new data, adjust the data-loading path and rerun cells in sections 2‚Äì9.
